## Pre-course
### Backgrund and preparation
When I enrolled in the PWK course, **I had worked as a software developer for 2 years** and had been working as a **Penetration Tester for another 2 years**. <br>
**Prior to OSCP I had not yet obtained any certification**, the only course I had taken was the eLearnSecurity's PTSv4, but without attempting the related eJPT certification.

Having been **self-taught for about 4 years**, **playing HackTheBox from a while** and now **working in the industry** from a couple of years, I already mastered the pre-requisites suggested by Offensive Security, so I decided to enroll.

***
## PEN-200 Course and Lab
I **enrolled** in the PEN-200 (PWK 2020) on the **15th of Jennuary 2021**. The course then **started** on the **24th of Jenuary** with **90 days of lab access**.


### Day 01-30
I spent the first month **looking at the course material** (850+ pdf pages and 17+ hours of video) and **doing the exercises** required to get the 5 bonus points during the exam. Although they were not difficult, the **exercises were many and required a lot of time to be done correctly** (to get the 5 bonus points the exercises must all be complete and correct), so I decided to start them from the first day. 

While reading the pdf I also began **structuring notes and cheatsheets** to use during the exam so that I would have all the useful references and commands ready at hand.


### Day 31-60
Finally after 30 days of exercises and notes writing I was able to start hacking some boxes. I decided to **start the journey following the [PWK Labs Learning Path](https://help.offensive-security.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050473812-PWK-Labs-Learning-Path)** and then proceed autonomously with the "*low hanging fruits*". 

In the meantime **I took notes for each one of the machines penetrated** and **I wrote short writeups** so that I would have an executive summary and a brief overview for each of them.

### Day 61-90
During the last month of access to the lab I did the **extra mile exercises** and I **hacked as many machines as possible**, trying to maintain an average of **1 machine per day**.

At the end of the lab time **I finished with 64 hacked machines** (out of a total of about 70), one domain controller completely compromised and access to all 3 internal networks.


### Up to the day before the exam
Between the end of the course and the final exam **I decided to let a month pass** in order to have the necessary **time to review or extend any doubts or knowledge** in addition to **writing the report of the lab** (a complete writeup of 10 machines with different attack vector + all pdf exercises) to totalize the 5 additional points.

In this month I have followed **two Udemy courses focused on Windows Privilege Escalation** ("*Windows Privilege Escalation for OSCP & Beyond!*" and "*Windows Privilege Escalation for Beginners*") and I kept **rooting as many machines as possible on HackTheBox** (I already had a VIP subscription) inspired by the lists of *OSCP like* machines that can be found on the web. 

![HTB_OSCP-like-machines.jpg]({{page.screenshots}}HTB_OSCP-like-machines.jpg)


During each penetration test I **always kept taking notes and writing writeups**, in order to keep my second brain always updated and organized.

I ended up with a total of 51 rooted machines on HTB:

**To retrain my Buffer Overflow skills** I also executed some exercises from the TryHackMe module **[Buffer Overflow Prep](https://tryhackme.com/room/bufferoverflowprep)** - *Practice stack based buffer overflows!*. 

***
## Day before the exam
The day before the exam **I stayed completely away from** the hacking world and **everything related to the certification**. I rested, I had company, I had fun and I tried to sleep as much as possible in preparation for the big day (sleep that actually lacked because of the pressure).

***
## Exam
### Day one
The exam started at 9am, the proctors were on point and I didn't have any kind of problem with the VPN or accessing the platforms. 

I **started right away with the BOF machine** (while the scans were running on the other machines) and after about **1 hour and 45 minutes** (yes, it took me longer than it should have according to my schedule) I got the first 25 points without any great difficulty. 

Afterwards, I decided to take a look at all the scans and tackle **one of the two 20 points machines** to take the pressure off. After about **3 hours** I got the user and after other **45 minutes** I got the full 20 points.

At that point **I decided to go ahead with the second 20 points machine**. After 2 hours and 30 minutes I got the user flag but from there **I got stuck on the privilege escalation** process for about 1 hour and 15 minutes so that **I decided to try** to approach **an easy win 10 points machine** to restore a mental balance.

The **10 points machine was really a peace of cake** and it took me less than 30 minutes to root it.

After the 10 points machine **I decided to try and tackle the last missing box** before going back to try the privilege escalation on the second Medium machine. After about **2 hours and 30 minutes** of intense enumeration I got the user and after other **45 minutes** I got the root flag.

Sure to have totaled a good margin of points to pass the exam (â‰ˆ90pt) I have decided to still try an hour of privilege escalation, however without success. In the remaining time of VPN access **I double-checked all the notes, procedures, exploits and I took any missing screenshots**.

Around 1:00 AM **I went to rest for about 4 hours** and at 5:00 AM I started writing the final report.


### Day two
The second day was all downhill. **The report** (which I had already structured in the previous days) **was just a sequence of copying and pasting from the notes** and a bit of research for vulnerability remediation, but nothing more than that. At **12:27** I had already finished checking the report and **I had already submitted it**.

## Certificate
**The day after** the delivery of the Lab and Exam reports (01/06/2021 @ 13:12) **I received the email confirming the achievement of the certification**.
<div data-iframe-width="150" data-iframe-height="270" data-share-badge-id="4d593371-2011-42f2-a299-f75cf614d881" data-share-badge-host="https://www.credly.com"></div><script type="text/javascript" async src="//cdn.credly.com/assets/utilities/embed.js"></script>

## Overview
My experience with this course and certification has been overall positive. Although I feel that the work required to obtain the 5 bonus points is excessively time-consuming (considering that access to the lab is activated from day 1 and that it is not possible to stop it) the experience in the lab was exceptional: 70 and more machines almost all different from each other, different Active Directories, different internal networks to reach, interdependencies between different machines. It was really fun!

PDF and videos are very well structured and clear, perhaps a little too redundant in the two versions (many times the videos merely repeated things seen in the pdf without further elaboration). Not a big deal anyway.

The exam was challenging but fun. Reporting was not an issue.

The key concepts for obtaining the certification are primarily three:
- **Try harder** (or rather "enuemreate harder")!
- **Organize your notes** and cheatsheet **properly** 
- **Google is your best friend**

If you can master these key concepts getting certified will be a breeze.
