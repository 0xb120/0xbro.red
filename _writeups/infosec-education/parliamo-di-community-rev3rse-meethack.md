## Introduction
I had the honour and great pleasure to be a guest of **Andrea (theMiddle) Menin** on his [REV³RSE security](https://www.rev3rse.it/) YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@rev3rsesecurity), together with other [Meethack](https://meethack.it/) friends and members, to talk about Community and much more!

🎙️ We told our story. We talked about what it means to be a cybersecurity community in 2024, the challenges, failures and successes.
Feel free to give a listen and maybe some feedback (sorry but the podcast is in Italian language only. Maybe some AI tools can help you, btw 😼)!
