## Introduction
In this video posted on my dear friend [Leonardo Tamiano's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@esadecimale), we discuss a CVE recently discovered by me, the [CVE-2023-47444](http://127.0.0.1:4000/disclosures/disclosed-vulnerabilities/opencart-CVE-2023-47444/), found in opencart, an open source e-commerce written in PHP. 

Since Leonardo is very interested in this type of research, he invited me on his channel to discuss the topic and my experience. In the first half he asked me a few questions about how I handled the research, and in the second half we talk about the responsible disclosure process and how it was handled (badly) by the project's maintaner, who instead of accepting my contribution, he decided to act ignorant and insult the work done.

If you haven't already done so, subscribe to Leonardo's channel on youtube, and follow his channel for more research, videos and technical contributions.

(sorry but the podcast is in Italian language only. Maybe some AI tools can help you, btw ðŸ˜¼)
