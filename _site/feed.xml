  <summary>Introduction  Happy 2026, two months late and with a new design for my blog! 🥳  It had been quite a while since I last posted anything on my blog, and recently I have been trying to find a functional system to best consume and process online information.  So here we are, writing a blog post that will allow me to clarify my ideas (hopefullyspoiler, it did!) and at the same time give you some ins...</summary>

  <summary>The Prevent Direct Access – Protect WordPress Files plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access and modification of data| due to a misconfigured capability check on the 'pda_lite_custom_permission_check' function in versions 2.8.6 to 2.8.8.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to access and change the protection status of media.</summary>

  <summary>Having well-organized notes is crucial for penetration testing, OSCP preparation and exams, CTFs, etc. They help you quickly identify previously exploited vulnerabilities and map the interconnections between machines within a network. In this video, I'll show you how I take effective notes using Obsidian's Canvas and Excalidraw, and how I structure them.</summary>

  <summary>This blog post shows a recent penetration test I performed for some customers' Salesforce applications (also called Salesforce Communities), in which I exploited some common and other lesser-known flaws, which eventually led to an account takeover vulnerability. I will show some plugins and in-depth techniques to facilitate the enumeration of the target and the discovery of these flaws, and I will link to other excellent resources that I have found very useful for delving into the Salesforce attack surface and on which I have relied to conduct tests and write this article.</summary>
