I"ò<p>Knife is a Easy difficulty Linux box from HackTheBox based on the exploitation of a backdoored PHP version. After having identified the backdoor by inspecting the source code on GitHub it is possible to obtain code execution and obtain an access as james. The user is allowed to run knife with high privileges. Since knife allows to edit files using vi and it does not drop privileges, it is possible to leverage this issue and escalate to root spawning an interactive shell from within vi.</p>
